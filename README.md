## Waterfall REST API

## Concept:
As long as water flows downhill, waterfalls will run over cliff faces large and small, compelling wonder and awe.
This API accepts location parameters via a REST endpoint and supplies a JSON response with information about nearby falls.

### REST Endpoints

waterfalls/ GET - Andrew created a class "waterfallByLocation", you can refactor name if needed.   
waterfalls/ POST  
waterfalls/ PUT  
waterfalls/ DELETE


### Example Application

Home page - index.jsp created with waterfallResults.jsp
- Ask user for location

Results List
- Display nearest falls in order by distance

### Create a hardcoded database (done)
We want to be able to have some data our REST can display to get credit for week 9 Exercise

*Two or three falls would be enough to show the closest* (done)
